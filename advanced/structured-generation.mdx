# Structured Generation

### What is structured generation?

Structured generation is a technique that constrains AI models to produce output in a specific, predefined format. Instead of allowing free-form responses, the model is guided to generate data that strictly adheres to a given structure. This approach significantly reduces errors and ensures consistent, reliable output.

### How UiForm uses structured generation for form filling

UiForm uses structured generation to automatically fill forms from documents with high accuracy:

1. Your form's JSON Schema acts as the structure definition
2. When users upload documents (invoices, contracts, documents, etc.), our AI analyzes them
3. Using structured generation, the AI extracts data in exact accordance with your form's schema
4. The extracted data automatically populates your form fields, ensuring perfect format compliance

This means when processing documents, you'll never get data in the wrong format or invalid values - the AI is constrained to only output data that matches your form's requirements exactly.
