# Streaming Output

Streaming results with **WebSockets** provides real-time, incremental updates during data extraction, improving responsiveness and user experience.

**How It Works**:
- **WebSockets** ensure persistent, two-way communication.
- Partial results are sent to the front end and displayed progressively.

**Benefits**:
- **Immediate Feedback**: Fields update as processing occurs, reducing waiting time.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users see meaningful data and know extraction is ongoing.
- **Engagement**: Continuous updates build trust and allow quick validation.

Streaming output minimizes delays and enhances usability for large document processing.
