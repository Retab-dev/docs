## Welcome to our API

Our API provides a set of endpoints that allow you to programmatically interact with our services. 
This documentation will help you understand how to use our API effectively.

Browse our endpoints by looking at the [endpoints](https://www.docs.retab.dev/api-reference/endpoints) section.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using our API keys. If you don't have an API key, please create one on our [dashboard](https://www.retab.dev/dashboard).
