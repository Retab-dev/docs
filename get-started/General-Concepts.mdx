## Sync & Async Client


UiForm offers both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** client interfaces, making it versatile for different application needs. The asynchronous client (`AsyncUiForm`) is ideal for high-performance, non-blocking applications where multiple tasks run concurrently. For simpler or blocking operations, the synchronous client (`UiForm`) provides a straightforward approach.

Hereâ€™s how you can use both:

```python
# Async client
from uiform import AsyncUiForm

async def fetch_models():
    uiclient = AsyncUiForm()
    models = await uiclient.models.list()
    print(models)

# Sync client
from uiform import UiForm

client = UiForm()
models = client.models.list()
print(models)
```

Both clients provide the same core functionality, enabling you to list models, create messages, extract data from documents, and more, with the flexibility to match your application's concurrency model.

## Pagination

Many top-level resources have support for bulk fetches via list API methods. For instance, you can list extraction links, list email addresses, and list logs. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these four parameters: limit, order, after, and before.

UiForm utilizes pagination via the after and before parameters. Both parameters take an existing object ID value and return objects in either descending or ascending order by creation time.

## Idempotency

The UiForm API supports idempotency which guarantees that performing the same operation multiple times will have the same result as if the operation were performed only once. This is handy in situations where you may need to retry a request due to a failure or prevent accidental duplicate requests from creating more than one resource.

To achieve idempotency, you can add Idempotency-Key request header to any UiForm API request with a unique string as the value. Each subsequent request matching this unique string will return the same response. We suggest using [v4 UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for idempotency keys to avoid collisions.


```bash Idempotency key example
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.uiform.com/v1/emails/test/webhook \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_a2V5XzAxSkgwVjhSN1ZaRTlYUzJYQzhOOTVRVDMzLEJSa3BzTEFuUTRVUWF5dEV5ZHpnRVZpVkI" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: cd320c5c-e928-4212-a5bd-986c29362867" \
```

Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. The UiForm API will generate a new response if you submit a request with an expired key.


## Rate Limits

UiForm implements rate limiting to ensure stable service for all users. The API uses a rolling window rate limit with the following configuration:

- **300 requests** per **60-second** window
- Applies across the following API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/documents/extractions`
  - `POST /api/v1/documents/create_messages`

When you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response headers will include:

```bash
Status 429 - {'detail': 'Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.'}
```

For high-volume applications, we can provide a dedicated plan. [Contact us](mailto:contact@uiform.com) for more information.


## Modality

LLM works with text and image data. UiForm converts documents into different modalities, based on the document type.

#### Native modalities

Here are the list of native modalities supported by UiForm:

<CodeGroup>

```python text
TEXT_TYPES = Literal[".txt", ".csv", ".tsv", ".md", ".log", ".html", ".htm", ".xml", ".json", ".yaml", ".yml", ".rtf", ".ini", ".conf", ".cfg", ".nfo", ".srt", ".sql", ".sh", ".bat", ".ps1", ".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx", ".py", ".java", ".c", ".cpp", ".cs", ".rb", ".php", ".swift", ".kt", ".go", ".rs", ".pl", ".r", ".m", ".scala"]
```


```python image
IMAGE_TYPES = Literal[".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".tiff"]
EXCEL_TYPES = Literal[".xls", ".xlsx", ".ods"]
WORD_TYPES = Literal[".doc", ".docx", ".odt"]
PPT_TYPES = Literal[".ppt", ".pptx", ".odp"]
PDF_TYPES = Literal[".pdf"]
```

```python audio
# Coming soon
```

```python email
# Emails are mime files which contains other mime files (their attachments). 
# Each mime file is converted into its native modality.
EMAIL_TYPES = Literal[".eml", ".msg"]
```

```python web
# MIME HTML files are converted into images (They can be obtained by saving a web page with the option "Single File")
WEB_TYPES = Literal[".mhtml"] # .webarchive coming soon...
```

</CodeGroup>


You can also use the `modality` parameter to specify the modality of the document and override the default modality.

```Python {14-15}
import json
from uiform.client import UiForm

with open("booking_confirmation_json_schema.json", "r") as f:
    json_schema = json.load(f)

client = UiForm()

response = client.documents.extract(
    json_schema = json_schema,
    document="booking_confirmation.jpg",
    model="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
    temperature=0,
    modality='text' # The image will be converted to text (with an OCR model) before being sent to the LLM
)
```


## Image Settings

When processing images, several factors can affect the LLM's ability to accurately interpret and extract information. The image_settings parameter allows you to tune images settings to improve extraction quality.
