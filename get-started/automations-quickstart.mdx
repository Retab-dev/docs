  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 1: Setup the Python SDK

To get started, install the `retab` package using pip:

```bash
pip install retab
```

Then, [create your API key on retab.dev](https://www.retab.dev) and populate your `env` variables:

```bash .env
RETAB_API_KEY=sk_xxxxxxxxx # Create your API key on https://www.retab.dev
```

Then, as we will use your API key to make requests to OpenAI on your behalf within a processor, you need to store your API key in the Retab secrets manager:

```python
import retab
import os

reclient = retab.Retab()

reclient.secrets.external_api_keys.create(
    provider="OpenAI", 
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

**Process your first document**

Here is how to process your first document with the create_messages method:

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py (OpenAI Completions API)
from retab import Retab
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize Retab client
reclient = Retab()

# Convert any document into LLM-ready format
doc_msg = reclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"  # Works with PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.
)

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-nano",
    messages=doc_msg.openai_messages + [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Summarize the document"
        }
    ]
)
```
```python main.py (OpenAI Responses API)
from retab import Retab
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize Retab client
reclient = Retab()

# Convert any document into LLM-ready format
doc_msg = reclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"  # Works with PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.
)

client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
    model = "gpt-4.1-nano",
    input = doc_msg.openai_responses_input + [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Summarize the document"
        }
    ]
)
```

```json doc_msg object
{
    "id": "doc_dd003f95-81ce-4a55-9180-00c5a58d82ec",
    "object": "document.message",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "INVOICE\n\nABC Logistics Inc.\n123 Shipping Lane\nPort City, PC 12345\n\nBill To:\nXYZ Corporation\n456 Business Ave\nMetro City, MC 67890\n\nInvoice Number: INV-2024-0123\nInvoice Date: 2024-01-15\nDue Date: 2024-02-14\n\nDescription:\n1.

        "name": "invoice.pdf",
        "mime_type": "application/pdf",
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>



### Step 2 : Create your JSON Schema

We use a standard JSON Schema with custom annotations (`X-SystemPrompt` and `X-ReasoningPrompt`) as a prompt-engineering framework for the extraction process.

These annotations help guide the LLM's behavior and improve extraction accuracy. 
You can learn more about these in our [JSON Schema documentation](https://docs.retab.dev/get-started/prompting-with-the-JSON-schema).

<CodeGroup>
```python Pydantic BaseModel (OpenAI Completions API)
from retab import Retab
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict

# Define your extraction schema
class Invoice(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        json_schema_extra = {
            "X-SystemPrompt": "You are an expert at analyzing invoice documents."
        }
    )
    
    total_amount: float = Field(...,
        description="The total invoice amount",
    )
    date: str = Field(...,
        description="Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Look for dates labeled as 'Invoice Date', 'Date', etc."
        }
    )

# Process document and extract data
reclient = Retab()
doc_msg = reclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"
)
schema_obj = reclient.schemas.load(
    pydantic_model = Invoice
)

# Extract structured data with any LLM
client = OpenAI()
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=schema_obj.openai_messages + doc_msg.openai_messages,
    response_format=schema_obj.inference_pydantic_model
)

print("Extracted data:", completion.choices[0].message.parsed)

# Validate the response against the original schema if you want to remove the reasoning fields
from retab._utils.json_schema import filter_auxiliary_fields_json
assert completion.choices[0].message.content is not None
extraction = schema_obj.pydantic_model.model_validate(
    filter_auxiliary_fields_json(completion.choices[0].message.content, schema_obj.pydantic_model)
)
```
```python JSON Schema (OpenAI Completions API)
from retab import Retab
from openai import OpenAI

# Define your extraction schema
schema = {
    "X-SystemPrompt": "You are an expert at analyzing invoice documents.",

extraction = schema_obj.pydantic_model.model_validate(
    filter_auxiliary_fields_json(completion.choices[0].message.content, schema_obj.pydantic_model)
)

print("Extracted data without the reasoning fields:", extraction)

```

```python JSON Schema (OpenAI Responses API)
from retab import Retab

        "total_amount": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "The total invoice amount",
        },
        "date": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Look for dates labeled as 'Invoice Date', 'Date', etc."
        }
    },
    "required": ["total_amount", "date"]
}

# Process document and extract data

    filter_auxiliary_fields_json(response.output_text, schema_obj.pydantic_model)
)

print("Extracted data without the reasoning fields:", extraction)

```

```python JSON Schema (Retab API)
from retab import Retab

# All-in-one extraction API
reclient = Retab()
response = reclient.documents.extractions.parse(
    document = "invoice.pdf",
    model = "gpt-4o",
    json_schema = {
        "X-SystemPrompt": "You are an expert at analyzing invoice documents.",

        "required": ["total_amount", "date"]
    }
)

print("Extracted data:", response.choices[0].message.content)
```
</CodeGroup>


### Step 3: Create your FastAPI server with a webhook


Next, set up a FastAPI route that will handle incoming webhook POST requests. Below is an example of a simple FastAPI application with a webhook endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from retab.types.automations.webhooks import WebhookRequest
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(request: WebhookRequest):
    invoice_object = json.loads(request.completion.choices[0].message.content or "{}") # The parsed object is the same Invoice object as the one you defined in the Pydantic model
    print("📬 Webhook received:", invoice_object)
    return {"status": "success", "data": invoice_object}

# To run the FastAPI app locally, use the command:
# uvicorn your_module_name:app --reload
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

You can test the webhook endpoint locally with a tool like curl or Postman. For example, using curl:

```bash testing locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"completion":{"id":"id","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"content":"{\"name\" : \"Team Meeting!\", \"date\" : \"2023-12-31\" }","role":"assistant"}}],"created":0,"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","object":"chat.completion","likelihoods":{}},"file_payload":{"filename":"example.pdf","url":"data:application/pdf;base64,the_content_of_the_pdf_file"}}'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>To continue, you need to deploy your FastAPI app to a server to make your webhook endpoint publicly accessible. We recommend using [Replit](https://replit.com/) to get started quickly if you don't have a server yet. An alternative is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.</Warning>

#### Step 3.1: Exposing local server to the internet using ngrok

We have a very simple Dockerfile that fastapi+ngrok to get you started.
Check out the [webhook_server](https://github.com/Retab-dev/retab/tree/main/examples/webhook_server) folder for more details.

<Tip>You will need a ngrok auth token to run the docker container. You can get one [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started)</Tip>

Start fastapi+ngrok server:

<CodeGroup>
```bash startup
git clone https://github.com/Retab-dev/retab.git
cd retab/examples/webhook_server
docker build -t webhook_server .
docker run --rm -it -e NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=[your_ngrok_auth_token] webhook_server
```

```logs {4} server logs
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
🌍 Ngrok tunnel established!
📬 Webhook URL: https://some-random-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/webhook
📬 Simple curl for testing: curl -X POST https://some-random-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/webhook -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"completion":{"id":"id","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"content":"{\"message\" : \"Hello, World!\"}","role":"assistant"}}],"created":0,"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","object":"chat.completion","likelihoods":{}},"file_payload":{"filename":"example.pdf","url":"data:application/pdf;base64,the_content_of_the_pdf_file"}}'
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
</CodeGroup>

Take note of the `webhook URL`, you will need it on the next steps.


### Step 4: Create your processor and automation

Instead of creating automations directly, you now first create a **processor** (which contains the extraction configuration) and then attach an **automation** (which handles triggers like emails) to it.

```python
from retab import Retab

# Initialize the Retab client
reclient = Retab()

# Step 1: Create a processor with your extraction configuration
processor = reclient.processors.create(
    name="Invoice Processor",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    modality="native",
    json_schema={
        "X-SystemPrompt": "You are an expert at analyzing invoice documents.",
        "properties": {
            "total_amount": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The total invoice amount",
            },
            "date": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
                "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Look for dates labeled as 'Invoice Date', 'Date', etc."
            }
        },
        "required": ["total_amount", "date"]
    }
)

# Step 2: Create a mailbox automation and attach it to the processor
mailbox = reclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.create(
    name="Invoice Mailbox",
    email="invoices@mailbox.retab.dev",
    processor_id=processor.id,
    webhook_url="https://your-server.com/webhook",  # Replace with your actual webhook URL
)

print(f"✅ Processor created: {processor.id}")
print(f"✅ Mailbox created: {mailbox.email}")
```

At any email sent to `invoices@mailbox.retab.dev`, the automation will use your processor configuration to extract data and send a POST request to your FastAPI webhook endpoint.

You can see the processor and automation you just created on your [dashboard](https://www.retab.dev/dashboard/processors)!

### Step 5: Test your processor and automation

Finally, you can test the processor and automation rapidly with the test functions of the SDK: 

```python
from retab import Retab

# Initialize the Retab client
reclient = Retab()

# If you just want to send a test request to your webhook
log = reclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.webhook(
    email="invoices@mailbox.retab.dev", 
)

# If you want to test the file processing logic: 
log = reclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.process(
    email="invoices@mailbox.retab.dev", 
    document="your_invoice_email.eml"
)

# If you want to test a full email forwarding
log = reclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.forward(
    email="invoices@mailbox.retab.dev", 
    document="your_invoice_email.eml"
)
```

<Tip>You can also test your webhook locally by overriding the webhook url set in the automation</Tip>

You can also test your processor and automation directly from the [dashboard](https://www.retab.dev/dashboard/processors):
<Frame>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Retab/retab/refs/heads/main/assets/docs/automation_test.png" />
</Frame>

```python
from retab import Retab

reclient = Retab()

# If you just want to send a test request to your webhook
log = reclient.processors.automations.mailboxes.tests.webhook(
    email="invoices@mailbox.retab.dev", 
    webhook_url="http://localhost:8000/webhook" # If you want to try your webhook locally, you can override the webhook url set in the automation
)
```
