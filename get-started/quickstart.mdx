## Introduction

UiForm is a powerful React library that enables you to generate beautiful, client-side validated forms directly from a JSON Schema. It simplifies form creation by leveraging schemas, ensuring minimal code and robust validation.

In this guide, we will:

1. Use **Pydantic** to generate a JSON Schema for your backend data structure.
2. Integrate the JSON Schema with the **UiForm** component in React to render a fully functional form.

Additionally, UiForm offers example apps to assist with integration and use-case demonstrations.

## 1. Installation

To get started, install the `@UiForm` package using npm:

```bash
npm install @UiForm
```

---

## 2. Generate a JSON Schema

You can create a JSON Schema using **Pydantic** in Python. Below is an example:

### Example Code

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import json

# Define a Pydantic model
class User(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    email: str
    age: int
    address: str

# Generate JSON Schema and save it to a file
with open("jsonSchema.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(User.model_json_schema()))
```

### Explanation

- The `User` class is a Pydantic model defining the structure of your form.
- `model_json_schema()` generates a JSON Schema based on the model.
- The schema is saved as `jsonSchema.json`, ready to be imported into your React project.

---

## 3. Render a Form with UiForm

To render a form from a JSON Schema, import the `UiForm` component and pass the schema as a prop.

### Example Code

```javascript
import jsonSchema from './jsonSchema.json';
import { UiForm } from '@UiForm';

const MyForm = () => {
    return (
        <UiForm
            schema={jsonSchema}
            className="border border-gray-300 rounded-lg bg-gray-50"
            onSubmit={(data) => { console.log("Form Submitted", data); }}
        />
    );
};

export default MyForm;
```

### Explanation

- **`schema`**: The JSON Schema imported from the file.
- **`onSubmit`**: Callback that provides form data when submitted.
- **`className`**: Allows you to customize the form's appearance using Tailwind CSS or other styling methods.

### Result 

And that's it ! Your form is generated based on the JSON Schema. Each field corresponds to a property defined in the Pydantic model, complete with client-side validation.

---

## 4. Customization and Notes

### Customization

- **Styling**: Use the `className` prop to apply custom styles via Tailwind CSS or your preferred styling method.
- **Layout** 
- **Custom Components**: Extend the `UiForm` component to add custom form elements or behaviors.

### Validation

UiForm derives validation rules directly from the JSON Schema, ensuring a consistent and predictable user experience.

### AI-powered forms

In the managed version of UiForm, AI-powered form filling is available via file upload, streamlining data entry for end users.
