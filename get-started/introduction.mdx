UiForm solves two major challenges in document processing with LLMs:

1. **Universal Document Processing**: Convert any file type (PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.) into LLM-ready format without writing custom parsers
2. **Structured, Schema-driven Extraction**: Get consistent, reliable outputs using schema-based prompt engineering

We see it as building **Stripe** for document processing.

Our goal is to make the process of analyzing documents and unstructured data as **easy** and **transparent** as possible.

Many people haven't yet realized how powerful LLMs have become at document processing tasks - we're here to help **unlock these capabilities**.

---

We currently support [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/) and [xAI](https://x.ai/api) models.

You come with your own API key from your favorite AI provider, and we handle the rest.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup the Python SDK">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process your first document">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract structured data">
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setup the Python SDK

To get started, install the `uiform` package using pip:

```bash
pip install uiform
```

Then, [create your API key on uiform.com](https://www.uiform.com) and populate your `env` variables:

<CodeGroup>
```python jupyter
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR-API-KEY" # Your AI provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
os.environ["UIFORM_API_KEY"] = "sk_xxxxxxxxx" # Create your API key on https://www.uiform.com
```
```bash .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY # Your AI provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
UIFORM_API_KEY=sk_xxxxxxxxx # Create your API key on https://www.uiform.com
```
</CodeGroup>

### Process your first document

UiForm handles all the document preprocessing - no custom parsers needed. Let's break this down into steps:

1. First, initialize the UiForm client and pre-process your document:

```python
from uiform import UiForm

# Initialize UiForm client
uiclient = UiForm()

# Convert any document into LLM-ready format
doc_msg = uiclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"  # Works with PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.
)
```

2. The `doc_msg` object contains the pre-processed document in a format ready for LLMs. Here's what it looks like:

```json doc_msg.json
{
    "id": "doc_dd003f95-81ce-4a55-9180-00c5a58d82ec",
    "object": "document.message",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "INVOICE\n\nABC Logistics Inc.\n123 Shipping Lane\nPort City, PC 12345\n\nBill To:\nXYZ Corporation\n456 Business Ave\nMetro City, MC 67890\n\nInvoice Number: INV-2024-0123\nInvoice Date: 2024-01-15\nDue Date: 2024-02-14\n\nDescription:\n1.

                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "created": 1736524416,
    "modality": "text",
    "document": {
        "id": "cf908729402d0796537bb91e63df5e339ce93b4cabdcac2f9a4f90592647e130",
        "name": "invoice.pdf",
        "mime_type": "application/pdf",
    }
}
```

It also contains other class methods like `items`, `openai_messages`, `anthropic_messages`, `gemini_messages`, `xai_messages`... See [Document Methods](https://docs.uiform.com/get-started/Documents-Methods) for more details.

3. Now you can use this pre-processed document with your preferred LLM provider:

<CodeGroup>
```python OpenAI
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
    messages=doc_msg.openai_messages + [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Summarize the document"
        }
    ]
)
```

```python Anthropic
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=doc_msg.anthropic_messages + [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Summarize this Document"
        }
    ]
)
```

```python Gemini
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure()
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
response = model.generate_content(
    doc_msg.gemini_messages + ["Summarize this invoice"]
)
```

```python xAI
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url = "https://api.x.ai/v1")
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages = doc_msg.openai_messages + [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Summarize the document"
        }
    ]
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Extract structured data with schema-based prompt engineering

We use a standard JSON Schema with custom annotations (`X-SystemPrompt`, `X-FieldPrompt`, and `X-ReasoningPrompt`) as a prompt-engineering framework for the extraction process.

These annotations help guide the LLM's behavior and improve extraction accuracy. 
You can learn more about these in our [JSON Schema documentation](https://docs.uiform.com/get-started/prompting-with-the-JSON-schema).

<CodeGroup>
```python Pydantic BaseModel
from uiform import UiForm
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict

# Define your extraction schema
class Invoice(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        json_schema_extra = {
            "X-SystemPrompt": "You are an expert at analyzing invoice documents."
        }
    )
    
    total_amount: float = Field(...,
        description="The total invoice amount",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-FieldPrompt": "Find the final total amount including taxes"
        }
    )
    date: str = Field(...,
        description="Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Look for dates labeled as 'Invoice Date', 'Date', etc."
        }
    )

# Process document and extract data
uiclient = UiForm()
doc_msg = uiclient.documents.create_messages(
    document = "invoice.pdf"
)
schema_obj = uiclient.schemas.load(
    pydantic_model = Invoice
)

# Extract structured data with any LLM
client = OpenAI()
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=schema_obj.openai_messages + doc_msg.openai_messages,
    response_format=schema_obj.pydantic_response_format
)

print("Extracted data:", completion.choices[0].message.parsed)
```
