## Overview
This tutorial guides you through the process of extracting structured data from the Airbnb pitch deck using UiForm, OpenAI, and Pydantic. We will define a schema to capture important entities from the document and use an LLM to analyze and extract relevant information.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- Python 3.8+
- `pydantic`, `dotenv`, `uiform`, `openai`
- An `.env.production` file containing your API keys

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pydantic python-dotenv uiform openai
```

## Step 1: Load Environment Variables
First, load the environment variables to access the API keys securely.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
assert load_dotenv(".env.production")
```

## Step 2: Define the Schema

### System Prompt

We will start by defining a system prompt that will guide the LLM to extract the data in the correct format.

```python
system_prompt = """
Your task is to extract structured information from pitch decks based on the provided schema. Carefully analyze the content to identify relevant details and populate each field accurately while maintaining consistency across extracted data.

Key Guidelines:
	1.	Understanding the Schema:
	•	The schema includes key entities such as the company, its investors, competitors, clients, team members, and business model. Each field must be carefully reviewed and filled with precise data extracted from the deck.
	•	Relationships between companies (e.g., investor, competitor, client) should be determined based on contextual evidence within the deck.
	2.	Contextual Analysis:
	•	Consider multiple slides to understand the startup's positioning, stakeholders, and market landscape.
	•	Extract information by recognizing patterns, such as recurring names or mentions in key slides (e.g., cap tables for investors, competitive analysis for competitors, and traction slides for clients).
	3.	Consistency and Accuracy:
	•	Ensure extracted data is consistent across all fields and accurately reflects the content of the deck.
	•	Avoid duplication or conflicting information by cross-referencing details from various slides.
	4.	Data Formatting:
	•	Company Name: Extract the official name as presented in the deck, ensuring correctness.
	•	Website: Extract and format URLs correctly 
	•	Country: Convert to the appropriate two-letter country code for uniformity.
	•	Business Model: Determine whether the startup follows B2B, B2C, or C2C based on their product offerings and customer base.
	5.	Handling Team Data:
	•	Identify key team members, ensuring correct extraction of their first name, last name, title, and previous experiences.
	•	Prioritize executives and founding members when available.
	6.	Dealing with Missing Information:
	•	If some details are not explicitly stated, infer them based on available context or leave them blank if they cannot be determined with certainty.
	•	Ensure no assumptions are made beyond what is supported by the content.

Extraction Output:
	•	The extracted data should strictly adhere to the defined schema, ensuring each field is correctly populated according to its description.
	•	The output should be structured, with proper data types (e.g., strings, enumerations, lists) and validated before final submission.

By following these principles, the extracted information will be comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the expected data structure for further processing and analysis.

```

Then we define a schema using Pydantic to represent the information to be extracted from the pitch deck.

## Step 3: Load the Document
We will use `UiForm` to load the pitch deck document.

```python
from uiform import UiForm

uiclient = UiForm()
doc_msg = uiclient.documents.create_messages(
    document="airbnb_pitch_deck.pdf"
)
```

## Step 4: Schema Creation
We create a schema object using the `Schema` class from UiForm to structure the extraction process.

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py
from uiform import Schema

schema_obj = Schema(
    pydantic_model=Deck
)
```
```python json_schema.json

## Step 5: Perform LLM Analysis
We use OpenAI's GPT model to analyze the document and extract structured data.

The reasoning fields (see `result_with_reasoning.json`) helps the model to reason about the data and extract it in the correct format.

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=schema_obj.openai_messages + doc_msg.openai_messages,
    response_format=schema_obj.inference_pydantic_model
)

assert completion.choices[0].message.parsed is not None
print(json.dumps(completion.choices[0].message.parsed.model_dump(), indent=2))
```

```json result_with_reasoning.json
{
  "name": "AirBed&Breakfast",
  "website": "airbedandbreakfast.com",
  "country": "US",
  "reasoning___investors": "1) The funding is specified in the Financial slide, indicating an angel round of $500K. 2) Although there are no named investors in the slides, the need for angel investment suggests relationships with high-net-worth individuals or investor groups interested in startups.",
  "investors": {
    "name": "Angel Investors",
    "type": "investor",
    "relationship": "investor"
  },
  "reasoning___competitors": "1) The competitive landscape is represented in the Competition slide which lists CouchSurfing, Craigslist, BedandBreakfast.com, Hostels.com, Rentabi.com, Orbitz, and others. 2) Features such as rental transactions and budget accommodation indicate they overlap with AirBed&Breakfast's offering.",
  "competitors": {
    "name": "CouchSurfing",
    "type": "startup",
    "relationship": "competitor"
  },
  "reasoning___clients": "1) The slides do not mention specific clients or partnerships currently signed on with AirBed&Breakfast. 2) Potential users, however, include travelers looking for budget accommodations, but this is more potential clientele than current clients.",
  "clients": {
    "name": "Travelers",
    "type": "startup",
    "relationship": "client"
  },
  "reasoning___team": "1) The team consists of Joe Gebbia, Brian Chesky, and Nathan Blecharczyk, all featured in the Team slide. 2) Each team member has definitive roles in User Interface, Business Development, and Development, which complement the startup's needs.",
  "team": [
    {
      "firstName": "Joe",
      "lastName": "Gebbia",
      "title": "User Interface & PR",
      "pastExperiences": "Entrepreneur and designer, graduated from Rhode Island School of Design."
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Brian",
      "lastName": "Chesky",
      "title": "Business Development & Brand",
      "pastExperiences": "Founder of Brian Chesky, Inc., industrial design consultant, graduated from Rhode Island School of Design."

      "lastName": "Blecharczyk",
      "title": "Developer",
      "pastExperiences": "Created Facebook apps, graduate from Harvard."
    }
  ],
  "reasoning___businessModel": "1) The business model is determined by the revenue generation method which is taking a 10% commission on each transaction as stated in the Business Model slide. 2) The primary customers are travelers and local hosts, confirming B2C positioning.",
  "businessModel": "B2C"
}
```
</CodeGroup>
## Step 6: Validate Extracted Data
Finally, validate the extracted data against the schema by removing reasoning fields.

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py
from uiform._utils.json_schema import filter_reasoning_fields_json

assert completion.choices[0].message.content is not None
extraction = schema_obj.pydantic_model.model_validate(
    filter_reasoning_fields_json(completion.choices[0].message.content)
)

print(json.dumps(extraction.model_dump(), indent=2))
```

```json final_result.json
{
  "name": "AirBed&Breakfast",
  "website": "airbedandbreakfast.com",
  "country": "US",
  "investors": {
    "name": "Angel Investors",
    "type": "investor",
    "relationship": "investor"
  },
  "competitors": {
    "name": "CouchSurfing",
    "type": "startup",
    "relationship": "competitor"
  },
  "clients": {
    "name": "Travelers",
    "type": "startup",
    "relationship": "client"
  },
  "team": [
    {
      "firstName": "Joe",
      "lastName": "Gebbia",
      "title": "User Interface & PR",
      "pastExperiences": "Entrepreneur and designer, graduated from Rhode Island School of Design."
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Brian",
      "lastName": "Chesky",
      "title": "Business Development & Brand",
      "pastExperiences": "Founder of Brian Chesky, Inc., industrial design consultant, graduated from Rhode Island School of Design."
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Nathan",
      "lastName": "Blecharczyk",
      "title": "Developer",
      "pastExperiences": "Created Facebook apps, graduate from Harvard."
    }
  ],
  "businessModel": "B2C"
}
```

	•	Relationships between companies (e.g., investor, competitor, client) should be determined based on contextual evidence within the deck.
	2.	Contextual Analysis:
	•	Consider multiple slides to understand the startup's positioning, stakeholders, and market landscape.
	•	Extract information by recognizing patterns, such as recurring names or mentions in key slides (e.g., cap tables for investors, competitive analysis for competitors, and traction slides for clients).
	3.	Consistency and Accuracy:
	•	Ensure extracted data is consistent across all fields and accurately reflects the content of the deck.
	•	Avoid duplication or conflicting information by cross-referencing details from various slides.
	4.	Data Formatting:
	•	Company Name: Extract the official name as presented in the deck, ensuring correctness.
	•	Website: Extract and format URLs correctly 
	•	Country: Convert to the appropriate two-letter country code for uniformity.
	•	Business Model: Determine whether the startup follows B2B, B2C, or C2C based on their product offerings and customer base.
	5.	Handling Team Data:
	•	Identify key team members, ensuring correct extraction of their first name, last name, title, and previous experiences.
	•	Prioritize executives and founding members when available.
	6.	Dealing with Missing Information:
	•	If some details are not explicitly stated, infer them based on available context or leave them blank if they cannot be determined with certainty.
	•	Ensure no assumptions are made beyond what is supported by the content.

Extraction Output:
	•	The extracted data should strictly adhere to the defined schema, ensuring each field is correctly populated according to its description.
	•	The output should be structured, with proper data types (e.g., strings, enumerations, lists) and validated before final submission.

By following these principles, the extracted information will be comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the expected data structure for further processing and analysis.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've successfully extracted structured data from the Airbnb pitch deck using UiForm and OpenAI, leveraging Pydantic models for data validation and schema definition.
