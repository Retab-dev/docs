### Output Monitoring

By monitoring how users edit and correct AI-generated form fields, we can assess the quality of AI predictions. Each user correction provides valuable feedback about where the AI made mistakes. Analyzing these edits reveals patterns in prediction errors and helps identify which form fields consistently need manual fixes. This data-driven approach allows us to measure prediction accuracy and track how often specific fields require corrections, giving clear insights into the AI system's performance.

### Backtesting

Backtesting validates new prompts or model versions against historical data. By comparing predictions to known outcomes, we can measure improvements and identify remaining gaps before deploying updates. This ensures reliable performance and minimizes the risk of introducing new errors.

### Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning uses collected corrections and backtesting results to retrain the model. This iterative process allows the AI to adapt to real-world data, reducing prediction errors over time. Refined prompts and updated models work together to improve accuracy and efficiency.

### Benefits

- **Higher Accuracy**: Fewer user corrections over time.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Saves time and reduces manual edits.
- **Increased Trust**: Reliable outputs enhance user satisfaction.
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Prompts and models evolve based on real feedback, ensuring continuous improvement.
